# EOS Bonds (T-Bills)

> EOS Bonds are a financial instrument that allows you to stake `$EOS` long term to the network in exchange for a fixed interest rate. The bonds are issued by the EOS network and are backed by the full faith and credit of the network. The bonds are sold at a discount to their face value and pay interest at maturity.

| Minimum denomination | Sold at | Maturity | Interest payments |
|----------------------|---------|----------|--------------------|
1 bond (1,000 EOS face value) | Discount | 4-, 8- , 13-, 17-, 26-, and 52-week | Interest and principal paid at maturity

## How it works

1. **Purchase**: You purchase a bond at a discount to its face value. The bond is denominated in EOS and has a face value of 1,000 EOS.

2. **Stake**: You stake the bond to the network. The bond is locked up for a fixed period of time and you earn interest on the bond.

3. **Interest**: The bond pays interest at maturity. The interest is paid in EOS and is calculated based on the face value of the bond.

4. **Maturity**: The bond matures at the end of the fixed period. You receive the face value of the bond plus the interest earned.

## Benefits

- **Fixed interest rate**: The bond pays a fixed interest rate at maturity. This provides certainty on the return on your investment.

- **Low risk**: The bonds are issued by the EOS network and are backed by the full faith and credit of the network. This makes them a low-risk investment.

- **Liquidity**: The bonds are transferable and can be sold on the secondary market. This provides liquidity to the bondholder.

- **Diversification**: The bonds provide a way to diversify your investment portfolio and earn a fixed return.

## Risks

- **Interest rate risk**: The interest rate on the bond is fixed at the time of purchase. If interest rates rise, the bond may be less attractive to investors.

- **Smart contract risk**: The bonds are issued on the EOS network and are subject to smart contract risk. If there is a bug in the smart contract, it may result in a loss of funds.

- **Liquidity risk**: The bonds are transferable, but there may not be a liquid secondary market for the bonds. This may result in difficulty selling the bonds at a fair price.
